# **Polyp Segmentation Using UNet++**

## **1. Business Objective**

Machine learning and deep learning technologies have seen significant advancements in healthcare and medical sciences. In some cases, these technologies outperform human doctors by identifying subtle features in medical images that are difficult for the human eye to detect. The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust deep learning-based system for **polyp recognition and segmentation** from colonoscopic images, aiding doctors in detecting and diagnosing polyps accurately.

---

## **2. Data Overview**

The dataset used in this project is the **CVC-Clinic Database**, which consists of frames extracted from colonoscopy videos. Each sample contains:
- **Polyp frames:** Images captured from colonoscopy procedures.
- **Ground truth masks:** Binary masks indicating the exact regions covered by the polyps in the corresponding input images.

### **Data Format:**
- Images are provided in `.png` and `.tiff` formats.
- Masks have the same dimensions as the input images, where pixel values indicate the presence or absence of a polyp.

---

## **3. Project Aim**

To build a deep learning model that accurately segments polyps from colonoscopy images by generating pixel-wise predictions.

---

## **4. Tech Stack**

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Deep Learning Framework:** PyTorch  
- **Computer Vision Library:** OpenCV  
- **Additional Libraries:** Scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, albumentations (for data augmentation).

---

## **5. Methodology**

### **Step 1: Data Understanding**
   - Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the structure and distribution of the dataset.
   - Visualize input images and corresponding ground truth masks to check the variability in polyp size and shape.

### **Step 2: Evaluation Metrics**
   - **Primary Metric:** Intersection over Union (IoU), a measure of overlap between the predicted mask and the ground truth mask.
   - **Additional Metrics:** Dice coefficient, Precision, Recall.

### **Step 3: Understanding the UNet Architecture**
   - **UNet:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for biomedical image segmentation.
   - Consists of an **encoder-decoder** structure with skip connections that help recover spatial information lost during downsampling.

### **Step 4: UNet++ Architecture**
   - **UNet++:** An improved version of UNet with densely connected skip pathways.
   - Introduces **nested skip connections** that facilitate better feature fusion and improved gradient flow.
   - Particularly useful for medical images with fine-grained features.

### **Step 5: Environment Setup**
   - Set up the development environment by installing the necessary libraries and configuring the hardware (preferably GPUs for faster computation).

### **Step 6: Data Augmentation**
   - Apply data augmentation techniques to improve the generalization capability of the model.
   - Techniques used:
     - Horizontal and vertical flips.
     - Random rotations and scaling.
     - Brightness and contrast adjustments.

### **Step 7: Model Building**
   - Implement the UNet++ architecture in PyTorch.
   - Configure the encoder-decoder blocks and skip connections.
   - Use **VGG-style blocks** as encoders for feature extraction.

### **Step 8: Model Training**
   - Train the model using a loss function that balances foreground (polyp) and background pixels.
   - **Loss Functions Used:**
     - Binary Cross-Entropy Loss.
     - Dice Loss (to handle class imbalance).
   - Implement callbacks for early stopping and learning rate scheduling.

### **Step 9: Model Prediction and Evaluation**
   - Generate segmentation masks for unseen images.
   - Evaluate model performance using IoU, Dice coefficient, and visual inspection.
   - Save the trained model for reuse.

## **6. Modular Code Overview**

The project follows a modular code structure for maintainability and scalability:

1. **`input/`**: Contains training data organized into two folders:
   - `PNG/`: Training images in `.png` format.
   - `TIF/`: Training images in `.tiff` format.

2. **`src/`**: Contains modularized Python scripts:
   - `ML_pipeline/`: Functions for loading data, preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
   - `engine.py`: Main script orchestrating the workflow.
   - `config.yaml`: Configuration file for setting hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size).

3. **`output/`**: Stores model checkpoints and predicted segmentation masks.

4. **`lib/`**: Reference folder containing Jupyter notebooks used for initial prototyping.

5. **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all dependencies and libraries required for the project.

## **7. Project Takeaways**

- Developed a comprehensive understanding of **polyp segmentation**.
- Learned to compute and interpret evaluation metrics like **IoU** and **Dice coefficient**.
- Enhanced skills in **data augmentation** using PyTorch and Albumentations.

## **8. Future Directions**

1. **Advanced Architectures:**
   - Experiment with **DeepLabV3+**, **Attention UNet**, or **SegFormer** for improved accuracy.
   - Use self-attention mechanisms for capturing global context.

2. **Ensemble Models:**
   - Combine multiple models (e.g., UNet++ and DeepLab) to create ensemble predictions.

3. **Real-Time Inference:**
   - Optimize the model for real-time inference on low-power devices using techniques such as model pruning and quantization.

4. **Transfer Learning:**
   - Use pre-trained encoders (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet) to improve feature extraction.

5. **3D Medical Image Segmentation:**
   - Extend the approach to handle 3D volumes (e.g., MRI scans) by implementing 3D UNet++.
